# Install plugins

# After https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/2674 gets resolved, install plugins from .gem files like this:
# $BOSH_INSTALL_TARGET/logstash/bin/plugin install $BOSH_COMPILE_TARGET/logstash/logstash-filter-alter-0.1.5.gem

# For now, we have to install from rubygems; meaning that the compilation VMs must have 'net access
$BOSH_INSTALL_TARGET/logstash/bin/plugin install logstash-filter-alter
